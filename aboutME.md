-  Hi, I’m @ratala321, I'm a new github member since october 2022.
-  I want to help other people on github because I think it is fun and I think it is a good way to expand my knowledge.
-  I'm currently learning c# (with Unity) and python (with the CS61A course). I plan to start CS in the winter semester.
